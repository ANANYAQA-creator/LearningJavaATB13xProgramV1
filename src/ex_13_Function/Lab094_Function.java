        /* Function - also referred as method in Java
         Function is a block of code which is used to perform specific tasks.
    Key Component of Java Functions:-

    1. Definition/Declaration :- A function must be declared within a class

    public returnType functionName (parameterType parameterName) {
    // body of the function
    }

    eg :- public static void main (String[] args){
    System.out.println("Hello World")
    }

    2. Calling :-  Untill you call the function, you can't run it
    // functionName(Arguments)

    * Main is also a function, which is called by the JVM
    public static void main(String[] args) {}

    There are two types of Function

    1. Built in Function :-  Pre defined
    2. User Defined Function :-  they are 4 types

    a.  Without Parameters and without Return types.
    b.  Without Parameters but with Return types.
    c.  With Parameters and without Return types.
    d.  With Parameters and with Return types.
